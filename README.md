# RG-Anderson-Model
A code that calculates the flow of the lowest many-particle energy levels of the single-impurity 
Anderson model via the numerical renormalization group method and based on the mapping 
to a tight binding chain as discussed in [Phys. Rev. B 21, 1003](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.21.1003) 
and [Rev. Mod. Phys. 80, 395 ](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.80.395).
